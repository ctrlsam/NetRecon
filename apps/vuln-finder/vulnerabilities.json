            "description": "According to its banner, the version of Squid running on the remote host is 3.1.x after or equal to 3.1.12.1 and prior or equal to 3.1.23, 3.2.x after or equal to 3.2.0.4, 3.3.x, 3.4.x, 3.5.x prior or equal to 3.5.28, or 4.x prior to 4.4. It is, therefore, affected by a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper validation of user-supplied input before returning it to users. A remote attacker controlled server can exploit this, by triggering error page delivery to a client with injected arbitrary script code that will execute in the client's browser session.",
